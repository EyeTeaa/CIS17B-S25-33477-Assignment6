When running the application using Qt Creator, run the program and then a screen will come up. 

Firstly, fill in the three text boxes in the top right add in some items
Add as many as you want and if there are duplicate IDs, and error will be handled, more on that later 
You will notice that the bigger text box on the top right is going to update with each added item 

There is also the Find and Remove Button that will find/remove by ID
If the item cannot be found and error will occur

ANY errors that occur will be caught and a message window will show up. 
Additionally, after closing that window, there will be a smaller text box showing the last error that was closed just for reference. 

Finally the menu on top: 
clicking help -> about will lead to my name and the project name 
clicking file -> exit will close the program.
